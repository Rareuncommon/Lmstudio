# FleetDeck Deployment Runbook

FleetDeck runs as a plain Docker image, deployed on TrueNAS SCALE as a Custom App. This runbook covers the app setup, a safe first bring-up, the one manual iPXE migration step, and rollback.

---

## 1. TrueNAS SCALE Custom App setup

In the TrueNAS SCALE UI: **Apps > Discover Apps > Custom App** (labeled "Launch Docker Image" on some builds — menu labels may vary slightly by TrueNAS SCALE version).

**Image**

- Repository/tag: your built image, e.g. `fleetdeck:latest` (push it to a registry the box can reach, or load it locally).

**Port mapping**

- Container port `8080` → a host port on the LAN, e.g. `8080`.
- FleetDeck serves the UI, API, and `/boot/*` all on this one port.
- Because `/boot/*` is unauthenticated (firmware can't log in), keep this on the LAN only.

**Environment variables**

Set these in the app's environment config:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `TRUENAS_URL` | Websocket JSON-RPC endpoint, e.g. `wss://192.168.1.36:8444/websocket` (verify the port on your build). |
| `TRUENAS_API_KEY` | API key from **Settings > API Keys**. |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | FleetDeck admin UI password. |
| `COOKIE_SECRET` | Random secret for signing session cookies. |
| `HTTP_PORT` | `8080` (match the container port above). |
| `DRY_RUN` | `1` for first bring-up (see step 2). |
| `DB_PATH` | `/data/fleetdeck.sqlite3`. |
| `IQN_PREFIX` | `iqn.2005-10.org.freenas.ctl`. |
| `GOLDEN_ZVOL` | e.g. `Main_pool/iscsi/win-golden`. |
| `CLIENT_ZVOL_ROOT` | e.g. `Main_pool/iscsi`. |

**Volume / storage**

- Add a **host-path volume** mounting a persistent dataset to `/data` in the container.
- This is where the SQLite file (`DB_PATH`) lives. Without it, all client/event state is lost on every app restart or upgrade.

## 2. First bring-up procedure

Bring FleetDeck up in read-only mode before it's allowed to touch anything.

1. Start the app with **`DRY_RUN=1`**.
2. Open the dashboard and log in with `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
3. Confirm FleetDeck's introspection worked: it should show your real `win-golden` snapshots (`@gold-vN`) and any existing iSCSI targets, read-only. Nothing should be created or changed.
4. Watch the events log — with `DRY_RUN=1`, actions you trigger appear as logged-but-skipped mutations. This is your proof that the TrueNAS connection and permissions are correct.
5. Once introspection looks right, set **`DRY_RUN=0`** and restart the app to arm real mutations.

Do not set `DRY_RUN=0` until step 3 is confirmed. A bad `TRUENAS_URL`, key, or zvol path is harmless in dry-run and destructive once armed.

## 3. The iPXE migration (one manual step)

This is the most important part of the cutover. FleetDeck replaces the nginx server at `192.168.1.246` that currently serves `/boot/<mac-hexhyp>.ipxe`. The network boot chain runs an iPXE script **embedded inside `snponly.efi`**, and that embedded script hardcodes the chain URL. To move the fleet to FleetDeck you rebuild `snponly.efi` with a new chain URL.

### a. Edit the embedded iPXE script

Locate the iPXE source's embedded script — typically a text file (often named `embed.ipxe` or similar) passed to iPXE's build via `EMBED=`. Find the line that chains to the current boot server:

```
chain http://192.168.1.246/boot/${net0/mac:hexhyp}.ipxe
```

Change the host:port to point at your FleetDeck deployment. Since the Custom App runs on the TrueNAS box, that's usually the TrueNAS host itself:

```
chain http://192.168.1.36:8080/boot/${net0/mac:hexhyp}.ipxe
```

Adjust the IP and port to match your actual FleetDeck deployment (`HTTP_PORT` / the host port you mapped).

### b. Rebuild `snponly.efi`

From a checkout of the iPXE source with a build toolchain installed, rebuild the binary with your edited embed script:

```
make bin-x86_64-efi/snponly.efi EMBED=/path/to/embed.ipxe
```

Notes:

- This is a one-time rebuild on a build host, not a FleetDeck runtime concern. FleetDeck never builds or serves the `.efi`.
- Point `EMBED=` at the absolute path of the script you edited in step (a).
- Use the target that matches your firmware (`bin-x86_64-efi/snponly.efi` for x86-64 UEFI).

### c. Redeploy the rebuilt `snponly.efi`

Copy the rebuilt `snponly.efi` back to wherever TFTP currently serves it from.

- **TFTP does not move.** FleetDeck does not serve TFTP in v1 — the TFTP server stays exactly where it is. Only the HTTP chain URL embedded in the binary changes.

### d. Test with ONE client before rolling to the fleet

1. PXE-boot a single test machine.
2. Confirm it hits FleetDeck: check FleetDeck's events log for a `boot.serve` entry for that MAC.
3. Confirm the client still sanboots correctly into Windows.

Only after one client is validated end-to-end should you consider the migration good for the rest of the fleet.

---

## 4. Rollback

- Keep the old nginx boot server (`192.168.1.246`) running **read-only** until the migration is validated across the whole fleet.
- Reverting is simply re-flashing the **old** `snponly.efi` (the one that chains to `192.168.1.246`). Keep a copy of it before you overwrite anything.
- Because the old server is untouched and still serving, rollback is just swapping the binary back — no data migration, no TrueNAS changes.
