# FleetDeck

FleetDeck is a single-container web app that manages a diskless Windows gaming fleet booting over iSCSI from TrueNAS SCALE. It replaces the manual workflow of hand-editing per-client iPXE scripts and clicking through the TrueNAS UI to clone, snapshot, and retire zvols. One dashboard drives the whole fleet: create a client, reset it to golden, rebase it onto a new golden version, retire it, or promote a new golden image — each as a single action, with every TrueNAS mutation recorded in an events log.

## Features

- **Dashboard** — live view of every client, its zvol clone, iSCSI target, and last boot.
- **One-click client lifecycle** — create, reset, rebase, retire, and promote-golden, each a single action against TrueNAS.
- **Bulk reset + nightly cron** — reset the whole fleet at once, or on a schedule (`node-cron`) for a clean image every morning.
- **iPXE script serving** — serves per-client boot scripts at `/boot/<mac-hexhyp>.ipxe`, with an unknown-MAC discovery/adopt flow so new machines show up in the dashboard ready to be provisioned.
- **DRY_RUN safety** — introspect TrueNAS read-only before letting FleetDeck mutate anything.

## Data model

SQLite (`better-sqlite3`), four tables:

| Table | Holds |
|-------|-------|
| `clients` | Provisioned machines: MAC, hostname, clone zvol, iSCSI target, golden version, state. |
| `settings` | Key/value app config (e.g. current golden version, cron schedule). |
| `events` | Append-only audit log of every action and TrueNAS mutation. |
| `discovered` | Unknown MACs seen at `/boot/*`, awaiting adopt. |

## Running it

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # fill in secrets and TrueNAS details
docker compose up --build
```

Then open `http://<host>:8080`.

### Local dev

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # keep DRY_RUN=1 for safe, read-only introspection
npm start
```

With `DRY_RUN=1`, FleetDeck talks to TrueNAS read-only and logs — but never executes — mutations. Ideal for developing against a real box without touching it.

## Environment variables

Set as env vars in the TrueNAS Custom App, or via `.env` for local/compose. See `.env.example` for the authoritative list.

| Variable | Purpose | Default / Example |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `TRUENAS_URL` | TrueNAS websocket JSON-RPC endpoint (port varies by build). | `wss://192.168.1.36:8444/websocket` |
| `TRUENAS_API_KEY` | TrueNAS API key (Settings > API Keys). Secret. | `REPLACE_ME` |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | FleetDeck admin UI password (single admin account). Secret. | `REPLACE_ME` |
| `COOKIE_SECRET` | Secret used to sign session cookies. Secret. | `REPLACE_ME` |
| `HTTP_PORT` | Port the HTTP server (UI + API + `/boot/*`) listens on. | `8080` |
| `HTTP_BIND` | Bind address. Keep on the LAN — `/boot/*` is unauthenticated. | `0.0.0.0` |
| `DRY_RUN` | `1` = log TrueNAS mutations without executing them. | `1` |
| `DB_PATH` | Path to the SQLite state file (mount a volume over its dir). | `/data/fleetdeck.sqlite3` |
| `IQN_PREFIX` | Base IQN for iSCSI targets. | `iqn.2005-10.org.freenas.ctl` |
| `GOLDEN_ZVOL` | Zvol path for the golden (sysprepped) image; snapshots `@gold-vN`. | `Main_pool/iscsi/win-golden` |
| `CLIENT_ZVOL_ROOT` | Root dataset path where per-client clone zvols live. | `Main_pool/iscsi` |

### The DRY_RUN safety flag

`DRY_RUN=1` is the seatbelt for first bring-up. FleetDeck still reads TrueNAS — you'll see your real golden snapshots and existing targets in the dashboard — but any action that would clone, snapshot, delete, or reconfigure a zvol/target is written to the events log and skipped. Confirm introspection looks right, then set `DRY_RUN=0` to arm mutations.

## Non-goals for v1

- No TFTP server (TFTP stays where it is today).
- No WinPE / wimboot hosting.
- No DHCP.
- No multi-server support (single TrueNAS box).
- No user roles (single admin account).

## Deployment

See [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md) for the TrueNAS SCALE Custom App setup and the one-time iPXE `snponly.efi` migration that points the boot chain at FleetDeck.
